## 🚀 Module Deep-Dive

### 🧾 POS Billing Terminal

> `/billing` — The heart of the system. A complete point-of-sale terminal with real-time invoice rendering.

- **Real-time invoice preview** — a live bill updates instantly as products are added, quantities adjusted, and taxes configured
- **Smart product search** — search by product name, brand, or barcode with OR-based fuzzy matching
- **Camera barcode scanner** — scan barcodes directly using the device camera for faster product lookup
- **Smart customer lookup** — enter a phone number to auto-fill returning customer details
- **Title-case formatting** — customer names are automatically capitalised (`vishal menariya` → `Vishal Menariya`)
- **Flexible payment modes** — Cash, UPI, Card, Bank Transfer, or Finance (EMI)
- **UPI QR code** — displays a payment QR code on invoices when UPI is selected
- **Partial payments** — accept partial amounts with the remaining balance tracked as due
- **GST calculations** — configurable SGST and CGST with real-time tax computation
- **Input validation** — discount cannot exceed subtotal, GST cannot exceed 100%, with red error indicators and disabled checkout
- **Discount support** — flat discount applied before tax calculation
- **Print-ready invoices** — branded Tax Invoice with GSTIN, owner details, amount in words, and bank details
- **Auto WhatsApp delivery** — PDF invoice is generated and queued for WhatsApp delivery on checkout

---

### 📦 Inventory Management

> `/inventory` — Full product lifecycle management with serialized IMEI tracking.

- **Category hierarchy** — parent and sub-category organization with inline management
- **Dual product types**
  - *Quantity-based* — for accessories (chargers, cables, cases)
  - *Serialized (IMEI)* — for electronics (phones, laptops) with per-unit IMEI tracking
- **Stock-in workflows** — add stock with cost price recording and complete audit trail
- **Low stock alerts** — configurable thresholds with dashboard warnings
- **IMEI duplicate prevention** — unique constraint enforced at the database level
- **Cost price masking** — staff users never see purchase/cost prices (enforced at API level)
- **Product search** — search across name, brand, and barcode fields

---

### 🧾 Invoice & PDF Engine

> A unified rendering pipeline — one component, one layout, everywhere.

- **Shared InvoiceTemplate** — single React component (`components/InvoiceTemplate.tsx`) used for both on-screen preview and PDF generation
- **ReactDOM-based PDF** — `client-pdf.ts` renders the same React component into a hidden DOM node, then captures via `html2canvas-pro` → `jsPDF`
- **Modern CSS support** — `html2canvas-pro` handles Tailwind v4's modern `lab()`/`oklch()` color functions
- **Branded layout** — TAX INVOICE badge, GSTIN, business logo, "WE BELIEVE IN QUALITY" banner, bank details, and authorized signatures
- **Conditional sections** — UPI QR code, due/paid amounts, and IMEI numbers render only when applicable
- **Amount in words** — Indian numbering system (Lakhs, Crores) with automatic conversion

---

### 💰 Due Payment Tracking

> `/due-payments` — Never lose track of outstanding customer balances.

- **Due payments page** — filterable list of all customers with outstanding balances
- **15-day overdue alerts** — dashboard component highlights bills unpaid for 15+ days
- **One-click settlement** — checkbox with confirmation dialog to mark dues as paid
- **WhatsApp reminders** — send payment reminders directly from the due payments list
- **Phone call integration** — tap-to-call for quick customer follow-ups
- **Automatic bill promotion** — settled bills transition from due payments to billing history

---

### 💳 Finance Tracking

> `/finance` — Track customers who purchased via EMI or third-party finance providers.

- **Finance provider management** — add, remove, and manage EMI/finance partners
- **Financed bill records** — link bills to finance providers with searchable records
- **Provider-wise filtering** — view all financed transactions grouped by provider

---

### 📊 Sales Analytics (Owner Only)

> `/analytics` — Business intelligence at a glance.

- **Revenue dashboard** — daily, weekly, and monthly revenue summaries
- **Interactive charts** — sales trends visualised with Recharts
- **Export to Excel/CSV** — download transaction data for accounting and tax filing
- **Staff performance tracking** — bills created per staff member

---

### 📱 WhatsApp Integration

> Automated invoice and reminder delivery powered by a standalone Express.js microservice.

- **Automated invoice delivery** — PDF invoices sent to customers immediately on checkout
- **Overdue payment reminders** — send custom reminder messages directly from the due payments page
- **QR code pairing** — connect WhatsApp via QR scan from the dashboard settings
- **Standalone Microservice (Deployment)** — the Baileys WhatsApp engine runs on a dedicated Node.js container (e.g., **Railway** or **Render**) to completely bypass Vercel's 10-second serverless timeout limits
- **Base64 PDF Pipeline** — dynamically generated PDFs are transmitted securely as Base64 strings from the Next.js frontend to the WhatsApp worker
- **Caption Integration** — bundles the PDF document and personalized text into a single, cohesive WhatsApp message bubble
- **Delivery tracking** — status logged per bill (`pending` → `sent` / `failed`)
- **Retry & resend** — resend invoices from billing history or bill detail pages
- **Auto-reconnect & Session Hygiene** — microservice reconnects automatically on disconnection and strictly purges unnecessary chat history/contacts to prevent server bloat

---

### 🔐 Security & Access Control

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **Password Hashing** | bcryptjs with salt rounds |
| **Session Management** | JWT tokens via NextAuth.js |
| **Route Protection** | Middleware-level auth + RBAC checks |
| **Data Isolation** | Cost prices filtered at API layer for Staff |
| **Input Validation** | Zod schemas for all API request bodies |
| **CSRF Protection** | Built-in NextAuth.js CSRF tokens |
| **Role-Based Access** | Owner (full access) · Staff (restricted — no analytics, cost prices, or user management) |
